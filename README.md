TO DO  
· change grid names to canvas and use grid to refer to borders  
· check for consistency between class and id selectors  
· fix right click painting  
· const boxes and const gridContainer.children are the same  
· improve tool picker  
· find a better solution for the bgcolor listener delay  
· check if doing box.classList.remove('painted') without checking if the class is there first is bad practice
